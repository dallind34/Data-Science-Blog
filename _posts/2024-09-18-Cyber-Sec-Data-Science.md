## Introduction

In today’s digital landscape, cybersecurity is more critical than ever. One effective way to safeguard your system is by monitoring network traffic to detect unusual or unauthorized activity. Packet captures, or PCAPs, allow you to record and analyze the data your computer sends and receives, giving you visibility into network communications. By using data science techniques, you can gain insights into which IP addresses your computer talks to the most and identify potential vulnerabilities.



## What is a PCAP?

A packet capture (PCAP) records the data your computer sends and receives, helping you see network activity and detect issues. tcpdump is a popular tool for capturing this data directly from your terminal. While other tools like Wireshark offer more visual interfaces, tcpdump is more lightweight and just as effective.

DISCLAIMER: A packet capture (PCAP) records the data your computer sends and receives, helping you see network activity, but it should only be used on networks where you have permission to monitor the network. Sometimes unauthorized captures can violate privacy laws.



## How to Capture Network Packets

To capture network packets using the command-line tool tcpdump, start by opening your terminal. Run the following basic command to capture packets on your network interface:

'sudo tcpdump -i any'

This command captures all traffic on all interfaces. To limit the capture to a specific interface, replace "any" with your interface name (e.g., eth0 for Ethernet). To save the captured data as a pcap file for later analysis, use the -w option:

'sudo tcpdump -i any -w capture.pcap'

This saves the captured packets to a file called capture.pcap in your current directory. You can now open this file using tools like tcpdump or Wireshark for further analysis. To stop the capture at any time, press Ctrl+C.



## Analyzing Packet Captures Using Python

Data science makes it easier to figure out which IP addresses your computer communicates with the most by analyzing network traffic. By looking at the source and destination IPs in the captured packets, you can count how often each one appears and rank the top IPs. Here’s a simple code snippet in python using the Counter to find the top 10 communicating IP addresses:


```python
import pyshark
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import Counter

def analyze_pcap(pcap_file):
    data = []
    capture = pyshark.FileCapture(pcap_file)
    for packet in capture:
        try:
            if 'IP' in packet:
                src_ip = packet.ip.src
                dst_ip = packet.ip.dst
                packet_length = int(packet.length)
                protocol = packet.transport_layer 

                data.append({
                    'Source IP': src_ip,
                    'Destination IP': dst_ip,
                    'Length': packet_length,
                    'Protocol': protocol
                })
        except AttributeError:   
            pass

    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    analyze_top_communicating_ips(df)
    analyze_protocol_distribution(df)

def analyze_top_communicating_ips(df):
    ip_counter = Counter(df['Source IP'].tolist() + df['Destination IP'].tolist())
    top_communicating_ips = pd.DataFrame(ip_counter.most_common(10), columns=['IP', 'Count'])

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.bar(top_communicating_ips['IP'], top_communicating_ips['Count'])
    plt.title("Top 10 Communicating IPs")
    plt.xlabel("IP Address")
    plt.ylabel("Packet Count")
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()


pcap_file = # Replace this with the path to your own PCAP file
analyze_pcap(pcap_file)


This code takes the list of source and destination IPs, counts how often each one is used, and then shows the top 10 in a bar chart. This way, you can easily see which IP addresses your computer is communicating with the most.



## Analyzing Protocols


Protocols, like TCP and UDP, play a big role in network security because they define how data is sent and received between computers. Monitoring which protocols are being used can help you spot unusual activity, such as unexpected protocols appearing in your network traffic. In the code below, we count how often each protocol shows up in the packet capture and visualize the results with a bar chart.


```python
def analyze_protocol_distribution(df):
    protocol_distribution = df['Protocol'].value_counts()
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    protocol_distribution.plot(kind='bar')
    plt.title("Traffic by Protocol")
    plt.xlabel("Protocol")
    plt.ylabel("Packet Count")
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()


Be sure to look out for suspicious protocols such as Telnet, FTP, TFTP, and RDP, which transmit data without strong encryption.



## Why Does This Matter?

Monitoring top IP addresses and protocols helps you quickly spot unusual activity, like unknown IPs or unexpected protocols showing up in your network traffic. This can be a sign of unauthorized communication or a potential security threat. Catching these early gives you the chance to block harmful traffic and protect your computer before any damage is done.



## Conclusion

In conclusion, using data science with packet captures is a powerful way to keep your computer safe by analyzing network traffic and spotting potential threats. Regularly monitoring your network and experimenting with different analytics can help you catch unusual activity early and strengthen your cybersecurity. Stay proactive to protect your system from unauthorized access and security risks.
