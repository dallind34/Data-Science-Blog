* Write the body of the blog using markdown.  There are a lot of references for markdown available.  I like the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) because many of the examples show both the markdown and the html code.  There are separate pages for [basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), [extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/), and a [cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for quick reference.
